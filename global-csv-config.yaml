description: |
  cert-manager is a Kubernetes add-on to automate the management and issuance of TLS certificates from various issuing sources.
  It will ensure certificates are valid and up to date periodically, and attempt to renew certificates at an appropriate time before expiry.

  cert-manager has the following [built in issuers][]:

  * ACME: sign certificates using Let's Encrypt (or any other [ACME][] compliant signer).
  * Vault: sign certificates using HashiCorp Vault.
  * Venafi: sign certificates using Venafi Cloud or Venafi Trust Protection Platform.
  * SelfSigned: the private key of the certificate will be used to sign the certificate.
  * CA: a private key stored as a Kubernetes Secret will be used to sign the certificate.

  [built in issuers]: https://cert-manager.io/docs/configuration/#supported-issuer-types
  [ACME]: https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8555

  cert-manager also supports [external issuers][],
  which are out-of-tree components that provide support for other certificate authorities, such as:
  [Google Cloud Certificate Authority](https://github.com/jetstack/google-cas-issuer),
  [AWS Private Certificate Authority](https://github.com/cert-manager/aws-privateca-issuer), and
  [Cloudflare Origin CA](https://github.com/cloudflare/origin-ca-issuer)

  [external issuers]: https://cert-manager.io/docs/configuration/external/

  In order to configure cert-manager to issue certificates, you must first create an Issuer or ClusterIssuer.
  These resources represent a particular signing authority and tell cert-manager how to handle your certificate requests.
  The [Issuer Documentation][] has more detail.

  [configure cert-manager]: https://cert-manager.io/docs/configuration/
  [Issuer Documentation]: https://cert-manager.io/docs/concepts/issuer/

  Once an Issuer has been configured, you can create a Certificate resource,
  which is a definition of a certificate request that is to be honored by an issuer
  and which is to be kept up-to-date.
  This is the usual way that you will interact with cert-manager to request signed certificates.
  The [Certificate Documentation][] has more detail.
